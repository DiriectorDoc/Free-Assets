# Cosmic Cliffs
## Animation Information

This animation was crated using frames created using [x4extended.png](x4extended.png) and [cropper.bat](cropper.bat). (WARNING: rendering all 1865 frames takes up more than 18 GB of space)

When replayed, this animation makes a seamless loop.

This worked was adapted from [NASA’s Webb Reveals Cosmic Cliffs, Glittering Landscape of Star Birth](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NASA%E2%80%99s_Webb_Reveals_Cosmic_Cliffs,_Glittering_Landscape_of_Star_Birth.png), a very high-resolution photograph of The Cosmic Cliffs, the edge of a nearby, young, star-forming region NGC 3324 in the Carina Nebula.

## File Comparison

Update 11/20/22: To save space on Mediafire (the file hosting system), libpng.mkv will no lobger be provided. If you wish obtain a collection of all frames as PNGs, feel free to download [x4extended.png](x4extended.png) and [cropper.bat](cropper.bat) to generate the frames yourself (note, this script uses ImageMagick through the command `magick`. Some older versions use the command `convert` instead and may require a tweak to the script).
