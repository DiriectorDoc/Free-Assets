When rendering this animation, the file size was unexpectedly monsterous, so the video had to be broken down into parts. To obtain a copy of this file, download all 38 parts, place then all in the same directory, open one of the files, and then extract the archived .mp4 file.

WARNING: This file is 3.5 GB large, which, believe it or not, if the smallest of the four usual formats. Due to the large file sizes, only the .mp4 render will ve abailible for download.
