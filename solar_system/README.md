## Animation Information

This animation uses the framenths extracted from [Solar-system-nl.svg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Solar-system-nl.svg) from Wikimedia Commons. It has been licensed under [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en).

This animation was crated using frames extracted from the animation found at [downloader.js](./downloader.js) and Node.js (WARNING: Rendering all frames takes up about 40 GB of space). Alternatively, you can download the [solar system - libpng.mkv](./solar%20system%20-%20libpng.md), however, this is not reccommented because PNGs in a matroska wrapper has low compatibility with media players.

When replayed, this animation makes a seamless loop.
